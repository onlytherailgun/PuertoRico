# PuertoRico

This is an demo project for learning Unreal4.

The target is create a digital edition for the famous board games 《Puerto Rico》.

The development plan of i made is as follows :

  1,build level and item for the game by translating an ue4 official demo.
  
  2,make sure the basic Controller works by the game rule. 
  
  3,code the logic or use blueprint for the element in the game.(maybe not including all element)
  
  4,code the main game logic,and at the end, one player should completely run the game.
  
  5,support two or more Controller.
 
  6,support hotseat mode , by using the new
controller.

  7,support network gamemode , hope tocrossing platform (if ue4 could worked as i wish , →_→).
  
  8,support AI player.
  
  9,Training the powerful AI by genetic algorithm ,and help me find the best way to win the game in the TeamBuild Party.(:-D)
